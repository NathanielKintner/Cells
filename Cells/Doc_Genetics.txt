All organisms are based on a genetic code. 
This code is simply a semi-structured string; less organized than a serialized object but more than random characters.

The code is broken into three layers, separated by pipe <  "|"  > characters
	1. Compound layer
	2. Parts layer
	3. Link layer


Compound layer:

gldjhcek;igcdd;gbinc;hmmei;en;ffmdbkc;nlafj;f;gdijije;fbllnjj;ncnimjl;fedj;m;iglfoha;cdmmbalgfc;elhfkg;bkmlh;hcddfoei;dc;lkdialm;

Alphabetic characters delimited by semicolons. Each of the sections represents a compound, which can be constructed from the elements with
the same name as the character.

There are exactly 256 ; characters in this string. After the last, there is a |


Following the |, we have the Parts layer.

This is a string 256*7 of hexadecimal values, each between 1 and 255, skipping the | character because that would be awkward

Starting from any point in this layer, we can define an organelle via the next six indices:
                                   startIDX                             +1                         +2                          +3                      +4                      +5
[stuff][things][garbage][whatever][index of compound in compound layer][this+math=critical region][this+math = organelle type][this+math = metadata 1][this+math = metadata 2][this+math = metadata 3][more garbage][whocares][bleh]


Then, another |. Then, the Link layer!

This is also hexidecimal values, with the same restrictions as the parts layer.

Each index of these can be interpreted as an index in the parts layer. This adds another layer of complexity however, in that it also starts
interpreting various parts of the parts layer as ways to find other locations in the links layer.
